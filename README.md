# About me
![Dellcash!](/assets/images/port.png "Dellcash")
I am a junior developer, of course **Self-Taught**.

You are probably familiar with the difficulty and know that it requires a lot of **Perseverance** and **Self‌‌-Control**.
> "Especially for someone whose job is 360 degrees different from programming."

The reason I was drawn to programming was because of the **Idea** and the skill I have in **Problem-Solving** , because I think the best place for it is programming.
